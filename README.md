# BMICalculator
This repository hosts a straightforward BMI (Body Mass Index) calculator implemented using fundamental web technologies - HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The calculator provides a user-friendly interface for inputting weight and height values, and then computes and displays the corresponding BMI along with a classification (e.g., underweight, normal weight, overweight, etc.).
